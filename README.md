# FACT-Prototype
This prototype is a web application designed for the use of FAst Container Transfer (FACT). This program allows you to allocate any weight from an existing contract to any containers made available to you. Each existing contract has current containers that have weight allocated within them. Each contract has a total weight. With this program, you can view all containers that are available and make a "transfer" to move around weight in certain containers. Once changes are made, these will be called pending containers. 

## Usage
This web application is deployed on Heroku with the following link:[insert link]. Once you follow this link, you are prompted to a welcome page. CLick on the "Get Started" button or "Contracts" button in the navbar to be directed to the list of contracts with only current containers (meaning no changes). To see a full detail view of each contract, simply select which contract you would like to view. This full detail view of the contract includes Contract Number, Product Company, Product, Operator, Total Weight, Contract Date, and Restrictions. Below that, there is a list of current containers that already have weight allocated in them with a link to its Bill of Lading and Chain of Custody. To make a transfer, you can access the form to do this through the "Transfer" and the "Reallocate Containers" button. The difference between these two transfer forms is that the "Transfer" button shows which container already has weight in it. The "Reallocate Containers" button allows you to transfer any remaining weight. The "Available Containers" button at the bottom will lead you to a table containing all available containers. The "Grade A - WWT" button shows all top rated containers. Now, when making a transfer, you are given access to use either percentages or units. Either option chosen will automatically convert the opposite field. Once a transfer is made, that contract is moved under the "Queued" tab in the navbar, indicating that there are pending changes needing confirmation. To see the full detail view of the queued contract, simply select it. This page will look fairly similar to a normal contract full detail view. Only exceptions are that the pending containers will be shown, pdf generation, and the ability to clear all pending. If you click "View PDF", a PDF will be generated in a separate tab to allow a user to sign these pending changes. If you click "Download PDF", the same PDF will be downloaded to your computer. If you click "Clear Pending", this button will clear all pending changes and revert back to the original contract. To import a new set of contracts, access the django admin site. A superuser has already been created with the username "admin" and password "admin". Once logged in, click on "Contracts. Through there, you can either add a contract manually or import. Due to deployment on Heroku, make sure to not let the server sit idle for too long (30 minutes) or else the site will take about 10 seconds to progress again. 

## Technical Work
This project uses django along with its class based views, sqlite, javascript, html, and css.
